# CouchDB Example Project
Example Project for using CouchDB 1.6. Based on the official documentation:

http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/intro/tour.html

This project is currently working on a Docker container. 

## Executing the project
To execute the service, just start Docker Toolbox and execute the command `docker-compose up`. And you will see the service running.

##Configuration
All the configuration of the Docker service is in the ´docker-compose.yml´ file.

## Updates
I will be updateing this project and documenting it with some BLog Posts on Medium:
